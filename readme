#Welcome here

App is almost ready, there is need to refactor some parts of the code, still I want to add gist copy function.


To run:

1. yarn install
2. node server.js

Some parts of the code are useless(for now) but are ready to implement routing for next functionality.
I need to implement some tests for this app
